# Node js HTTP request to cURL

Tired to manually generate curl from nodejs request for debugging proposes? Need to export nodejs request to your REST client (e.g. [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) and [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/))? http-to-curl come to the rescue!!

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

```sh
yarn add http-to-curl
# old way
npm install http-to-curl --save
```

## Usage üìö

```js
// import httpToCurl on your server entry point of your project or code (e.g. server.js / index.js)
import httpToCurl from 'http-to-curl';
httpToCurl();

// Traditional way
const httpToCurl = require('http-to-curl').default;
httpToCurl();

//  Use your favorite http client to fetch (e.g. axios, isomorphic fetch or even vanilla request) all works well with http-to-curl.
//  In this example we are using axios.

import axios from 'axios'
const options = {
  url: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1',
  method: 'get'
};

//Output
curl "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1" -X GET -H "Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*" -H "User-Agent: axios/0.18.0"
```

It will listen all your nodejs http request and generate curl for each request. Its support all method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE & PATCH)

# Options

## 1. Filtering ‚úÖ

`http-to-curl` support filtering url using regex and string. Only match url will be generated.

```js
import httpToCurl from 'http-to-curl';
//Single url match
const options = {
  filter: /api\/v1/
}
httpToCurl(options);
//Multiple url match
const options = {
  filter: [/api\/v1/, /api\/v3/]
}
httpToCurl(options);
```

## 2. Custom callback ‚öôÔ∏è

```js
const options = {
  customCallback: function(curlString) {
    console.log('hey this is the custom callback', curlString);
  },
};
httpToCurl(options);
```


## 3. Disable output üëÅ
This flag defaults to `true` and displays the output `curl` commands.  You may disable output from this library.
```js
const options = {
  showOutput: false
}
httpToCurl(options);
```

# Building and using the library locally
To avoid the need for installing the necessary libraries, the build can be performed within a Docker container.

### Prequisite
- Docker

### Instructions
In the project root folder, run the following commands.
```bash
docker build -t http-to-curl .
docker run --name builder -it http-to-curl
docker cp builder:/app/lib .
docker container rm builder
```

You may now reference the project directly using
```js
require('<path to project>');
```
